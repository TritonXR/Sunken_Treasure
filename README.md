# SunkenTreasure
Triton XR Project Sunken Treasure 2020
The goal of this project is to create a curated VR experience for the user by combining visual modality such as hand presence with tactile feedback by placing objects in the real world and mapping them 1-to-1 with objects in the virtual space.
